TODO:
- Player
1. player::move() may need to return something to indicate if move is successful (dont implement this just yet)

- Human (player)
1. human::move(), don't need to read in command again, make a do while, break upon valid pos and dest


problem: 
when human::move is called, the first cmd input "move" is already read in from chess
so should only need to process pos and validity and ........











- Chess (concrete subject)
********* 1. when processing command == "move" check if stalemate/checkmate/check && display message
should the curboard, prevboard, and players be deleted if gameRunning is false???



2. notifyObserver() whenever need to render board (after game, move, each step in setup) && display result after resign

3. at the end of setup::done
// if board is stalemate on current team, output message, increase win count, playing = false
// else playing = true

4. undo() not implemented yet
game must be running
prevboard != nullptr

delete curboard
curboard = prevboard
prevboard = nullptr
change current player


5. getState() not implemented yet, what is it for?
return pointer/ref to current board











- Subject
1. subject::detach(), pop specific observer!!! not just pop_back(), check my a4q4
2. obs instead of os


- Observer
1. empty


- Textrender (concrete subject)
1. dne
