how to check if current piece is under capture:

regular piece is under capture 
1. enemy piece can capture current piece
2. the capture move is valid
    2.1 after capture move, we now have a NEWBOARD
    2.2 the enemy king is NOT under capture in the NEWBOARD

king is under capture (AKA undercheck)
1. enemy piece can capture king (DONT need to worry if enemy king is under capture after the capture move)





make sure validMove() check if dest is same team




************************************************************
add constructor to all piece class











in pieces::moveto(), it should reset enpassant status for every single piece (perhaps add some virtual function in Piece)

in Pawn::moveto(), it should first reset ALL enpassant status, THEN activate CUR PAWN's enpassant status IF its moving for the first
time and move is 2 blocks, and there are enemy pawns beside it after the move

so if the black pawn beside it, tries to move sideways in the following move, it will be allowed

AKA, in pawn::validmove(), if trying to move sideways by 1, and dest is ENEMY PAWN with enpassant activated, the move will be valid
