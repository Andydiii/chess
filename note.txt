check & capture are easy to check
in validmove(), check if after move, enemy is captured or enemy king is now in check

for escape, need to track if cur piece is udnercap before and after move

(done) when leave setup, should set capture status for all pieces
(done) when making newboard, should set capture status for all pieces

(do this now) after move, should update capture status for all pieces
